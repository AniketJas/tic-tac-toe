          Tic-tac-toe is a classic game played on a 3x3 grid. Two players,
          usually represented as "X" and "O," take turns marking empty squares.
          The objective is to form a line of three of your symbols horizontally,
          vertically, or diagonally.
        </p>
        <br />

        <p>Here are the basic rules:</p>

        <ol type="1">
          <li>
            Players take turns placing their symbol in an empty square on the
            grid.
          </li>
          <li>
            The game starts with an empty grid. X typically goes first, followed
            by O, alternating until the game ends.
          </li>
          <li>
            A player wins if they successfully create a line of three of their
            symbols in any direction.
          </li>
          <li>
            If all squares are filled without a winner, the game ends in a draw.
          </li>
          <li>Players cannot overwrite each other's symbols once placed.</li>
          <li>Once a player achieves victory or a draw, the game ends.</li>
        </ol>
        <br />
        <p>
          Tic-tac-toe is a simple yet strategic game, often played for
          entertainment and as a teaching tool for basic game theory.
